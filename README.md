PavitraContract: A Simple Account Management Contract (Solidity)

This Solidity contract, named PavitraContract, implements basic functionalities for managing an account balance.
It demonstrates the use of require(), revert(), and assert() statements for security and internal checks.



Features:


Stores a public balance variable to track the account's funds.

Allows deposits with a minimum amount restriction (deposit).

Allows withdrawals with sufficient balance checks (withdraw).

Includes an emergency withdrawal function with additional security measures (emergencyWithdraw).

Provides a checkBalance function to retrieve the current balance (view function).



Security and Error Handling:


require() statements ensure critical conditions are met before proceeding. They revert the transaction with a message if the condition fails.

deposit requires a minimum deposit amount.

withdraw requires sufficient balance to avoid negative balances.

revert() is used explicitly in the emergencyWithdraw function to revert the transaction if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.

assert() is used for internal state checks (withdraw) but is generally discouraged for production environments due to gas inefficiency.



Deployment and Usage:


Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler.

Deploy the contract to a blockchain network (e.g., test network).

Interact with the contract functions using a web3 wallet or development tools.

Call deposit(amount) to deposit funds into the account (ensuring the amount is greater than 30).

Call withdraw(amount) to withdraw funds from the account (ensuring sufficient balance).

Call emergencyWithdraw(amount) to withdraw funds even if the balance is insufficient (but the transaction will revert).

Call checkBalance() to view the current account balance.



Limitations:


This is a simplified example and lacks features like:
Transferring funds to other accounts.
Access control for functions (anyone can interact with the contract).
Security should be a top priority for real-world applications. Consider additional security measures like access control and proper error handling.
